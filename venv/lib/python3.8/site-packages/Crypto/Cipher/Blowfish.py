"""Blowfish symmetric cipher

Blowfish_ is a symmetric block cipher designed by Bruce Schneier.

It has a fixed data block size of 8 bytes and its keys can vary in length
from 32 to 448 bits (4 to 56 bytes).

Blowfish is deemed secure and it is fast. However, its keys should be chosen
to be big enough to withstand a brute force attack (e.g. at least 16 bytes).

**Use AES, not Blowfish. This module is provided only for legacy purposes.**

As an example, encryption can be done as follows:

    >>> from Crypto.Cipher import Blowfish
    >>> from struct import pack
    >>>
    >>> bs = Blowfish.block_size
    >>> key = b'An arbitrarily long key'
    >>> cipher = Blowfish.new(key, Blowfish.MODE_CBC)
    >>> plaintext = b'docendo discimus '
    >>> plen = bs - len(plaintext) % bs
    >>> padding = [plen]*plen
    >>> padding = pack('b'*plen, *padding)
    >>> msg = cipher.iv + cipher.encrypt(plaintext + padding)

    :Parameters:
      key : byte string
        The secret key to use in the symmetric cipher.
        Its length can vary from 5 to 56 bytes.

      mode : a *MODE_** constant
        The chaining mode to use for encryption or decryption.

    :Keywords:
      iv : byte string
        (*Only* `MODE_CBC`, `MODE_CFB`, `MODE_OFB`, `MODE_OPENPGP`).

        The initialization vector to use for encryption or decryption.

        For `MODE_OPENPGP`, IV must be 8 bytes long for encryption
        and 10 bytes for decryption (in the latter case, it is
        actually the *encrypted* IV which was prefixed to the ciphertext).

        For all other modes, it must be 8 bytes long.

        If not provided, a random byte string will be generated (you must
        read it back via the ``iv`` attribute).

      nonce : byte string
        (*Only* `MODE_EAX` and `MODE_CTR`).
        A value that must never be reused for any other encryption.

        For `MODE_CTR`, its length must be in the range ``[0..7]``.

        For `MODE_EAX`, there are no restrictions, but it is recommended to
        use at least 16 bytes.

        If not provided for `MODE_EAX`, a 16 byte random string will be used
        (you can read it back via the ``nonce`` attribute).

      mac_len : integer
        (*Only* `MODE_EAX`). Length of the authentication tag, in bytes.
        It must be no larger than 8 (which is the default).

      segment_size : integer
        (*Only* `MODE_CFB`).The number of bits the plaintext and ciphertext
        are segmented in. It must be a multiple of 8.
        If not specified, it will be assumed to be 8.

      initial_value : integer
        (*Only* `MODE_CTR`). The initial value for the counter within
        the counter block. By default it is 0.

    :Return: a Blowfish cipher object, of the applicable mode:

        - CBC_ mode
        - CFB_ mode
        - CTR_ mode
        - EAX_ mode
