"""Triple DES symmetric cipher

`Triple DES`__ (or TDES or TDEA or 3DES) is a symmetric block cipher
standardized by NIST_. It has a fixed data block size of 8 bytes.

TDES consists of the concatenation of 3 simple Single `DES` ciphers
(encryption - decryption - encryption), where each stage uses an
indipendent sub-key.

A TDES key is therefore 24 (8+8+8) bytes long. However, like Single DES,
only 7 out of 8 bits are actually used: the remaining ones are parity
bits (which practically all TDES implementations ignore).
Theoreticaly, Triple DES achieves up to 112 bits of effective security.

Triple DES can also operate with a 16 bytes key (Option 2, also termed 2TDES),
in which case subkey *K1* equals subkey *K2*. The effective security
is as low as `90 bits`_.

Thi implementation checks and enforces the condition *K1 != K2 != K3*
(Option 3), as it degrades Triple DES to Single DES.

*Use AES, not TDES. This module is provided for legacy purposes only.**

As an example, encryption can be done as follows:

    >>> from Crypto.Cipher import DES3
    >>> from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes
    >>>
    >>> # When generating a Triple DES key you must check that
    >>> # subkey1 != subkey2 and subkey2 != subkey3
    >>> while True:
    >>>     try:
    >>>         key = DES3.adjust_key_parity(get_random_bytes(24))
    >>>         break
    >>>     except ValueError
    >>>         pass
    >>>
    >>> cipher = DES3.new(key, DES3.MODE_CFB)
    >>> plaintext = b'We are no longer the knights who say ni!'
    >>> msg = cipher.nonce + cipher.encrypt(plaintext)

    :Parameters:
      key : byte string
        The secret key to use in the symmetric cipher.
        It must be 16 or 24 bytes long. The parity bits will be ignored.
        The condition K1 != K2 != K3 must hold.

      mode : a *MODE_** constant
        The chaining mode to use for encryption or decryption.

    :Keywords:
      iv : byte string
        (*Only* `MODE_CBC`, `MODE_CFB`, `MODE_OFB`, `MODE_OPENPGP`).

        The initialization vector to use for encryption or decryption.

        For `MODE_OPENPGP`, IV must be 8 bytes long for encryption
        and 10 bytes for decryption (in the latter case, it is
        actually the *encrypted* IV which was prefixed to the ciphertext).

        For all other modes, it must be 8 bytes long.

        If not provided, a random byte string will be generated (you can read
        it back via the ``iv`` attribute).

      nonce : byte string
        (*Only* `MODE_EAX` and `MODE_CTR`)
        A value that must never be reused for any other encryption.

        For `MODE_CTR`, its length must be in the range ``[0..7]``.

        For `MODE_EAX`, there are no restrictions, but it is recommended to
        use at least 16 bytes.

        If not provided for `MODE_EAX`, a random 16 byte string is generated
        (you can read it back via the ``nonce`` attribute).

      mac_len : integer
        (*Only* `MODE_EAX`). Length of the authentication tag, in bytes.
        It must be no larger than 8 (which is the default).

      segment_size : integer
        (*Only* `MODE_CFB`).The number of **bits** the plaintext and ciphertext
        are segmented in. It must be a multiple of 8.
        If not specified, it will be assumed to be 8.

      initial_value : integer
        (*Only* `MODE_CTR`). The initial value for the counter within
        the counter block. By default it is 0.

    :Attention: it is important that all 8 byte subkeys are different,
      otherwise TDES would degrade to single `DES`.

    :Raise ValueError:
      when the key degrades to Single DES.

    :Return: a DES cipher object, of the applicable mode:
